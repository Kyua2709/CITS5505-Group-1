You never had to take a break from thinking too hard?
No thoughts  Head empty  RELOAD
Also why does luna lose her ability to dance most of the time? Is she stupid?

Why does Groot have to reload his arms ?   Why does Namor have infinite spears to throw ?  Why does Strange need to reload magic ?  And why does Adam not fly ?  Some question are not meant to be answered, and we are not meant to know why some things happen, we just have to accept them.
she doesnt have adhd
Sheâ€™s taking a mental break
Clearly you have never met a white woman who has yet to have their morning coffee.
You reload your brain every night for 8 hours when you sleep, and youâ€™re not using it to send out a powerful psionic beam. She can take a couple of secs to compose herself
It helps when your think tank takes a breather so they can refocus.
You ever been on reddit and read a comment so bad that you feel dumber because of it? Gotta restore them brain cells
Same reason Groot needs to reload his arms, Mantis needs to reload her martial arts, and Strange has to reload his magic.
Brain freeze
simple she has to collect her thoughts
She's gathering her thoughts
I mean dont you?
Bc she gets tired of running through my mind all day
It is due to this organic lifeform simply being an inferior entity compared to the superior robotic existence of the collective.
The amount of brain cancer she gets from seeing the hawkeye pushing to front and blaming heals when he goes 3-19 with 1000 damage and 0 final hits
these questions are getting so tiring. because of video game balance.
why does strange reload his hands
I mean storm needs to reload wind somehow
ADHD
she should've eating peanuts as reload animation
God forbid a woman needs a moment to gather her thoughts
Us non-mutants take mental health days to free ourselves from work and other life stressors. As a mutant she only needs a second or two.
Same reason Storm has to reload the wind!
Psychic powers hurt the mind, her reloading is basically popping an advil
her arm gets tired from holding it up for so long
Brother, thinking to hard HURTS.
The strain on her mind maybe
The reload is her popping an aspirin from the massive headache she put on herself.
She probably needs to collect a bunch of her targets most cringe inducing memories or something
Shes taking a Deeeep breath and shaking off the bad vibes she picked up from you and your squad
So she doesn't get brainfrost.
Why does groot need to reload his arms?
Autism..?
Brain freeze
she's having second thoughts
Brain freeze
You never argued with a woman? They have active reload in real time.
Ya know when you have to really push a shit out and you get out of breath and need to take a second to recuperate before pushing some more?   It's like that.
Same reason Storm reloads the wind
Headache
I want colossus to reload his arms  https://i.redd.it/5l7h3ceecwze1.gif
I donâ€™t understand how players canâ€™t grasp that games like this need to have some kind of balance, lol.  Why canâ€™t Wanda just blow up the whole map?  ![gif](giphy|1Pfd5qmaqBvjO)
Why does Hawkeye not have to take arrows out of his quiver?
I remember studying for my math national exam for a week straight as a fairly dumb kid, shit syphons your brain juices.
welcome back overwatch 1 community
Even telepaths have cognitive loads they need to recover from
Balance or something idk
Probably cause balence reason especially how strong that shit is
As someone who writes code for a living, this tracks.
She's holding space
Why does Groot need to reload his body?
Because it's a video game
This is like, the easiest one to attach a headcanon to tho. She simply needs to refocus. I imagine firing a beam of telepathic energy out of your head consistently is very difficult.
Collect her thoughts.
Because it's a video game
Why does magneto not crush ironman instantly
Cause itâ€™s a video game
Because overthinking is unhealthy
Lmao
I always thought the same thing with Groot. He pulls his arms back too.
Because she's making the sound effect with her mouth and needs to take a breath
![gif](giphy|T24KZhJKjWxDNahGtC)
She needs a mental reset
She needs a mental recharge
Like Elon Musk. This is normal, you need to reboot.  ![gif](giphy|E5dXXXETfeMOa49PKM|downsized)
Because she's slow
Just played rank 3 gold on Dr.Strange, my dumbass thought a jeff was healing and turned around its emma frost. Bruh!
Brain Freeze
Is she stupid?
Balance
To avoid brain freeze
You wanna give her a migraine?! You're evil!!
Because they're mind bullets......that's telekinesis Kyle
And you donâ€™t?
Is she stupid?
She just needs a brain break.
Cuz of brain freezeðŸ˜‚
Why does spiderman move faster than torch can fly...and why does melee and webs work against torch.... Whose base plasma self is at a consistent 780 degrees Fahrenheit.  That's without him putting in much more effort.  So...yeah.   Why can spiderman punch harder than hulk, move faster than torch...and land blows on a man wreathed in flaming plasma?
Sheâ€™s tried nothing and sheâ€™s all out of options.
Idk when your thinking hard while taking hundreds to thousands of attacks/bullets maybe you need to recalibrate
She has to do so to stop herself from getting a migraine
Brain freeze, too much ice.
The same Storm has to reload the wind.... Because unlimited ammo would be unbalanced *caught in Namor/Peni*
She has to refresh the wrinkles in her brain on reload to keep her smartness up.
why does Storm need to reload wind?
Brain freeze!ðŸ¥¶
It's a videogame. That's why. Balancing.
